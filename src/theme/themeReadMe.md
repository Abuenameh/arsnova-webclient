# How to add a new Theme

- create a new directory with the name of the theme in src/theme
- than create a new scss file with the same construct as _dark-theme.scss and style it using 
  material palette
- import the file in styles.scss and add the option in header.component.html

- create a new scss file in your working theme directory : name.const.ts 
  and copy the construct of darkTheme.const.ts
- start editing the variables and see the magic happen
