This document is intended for developers who are modifying or extending ARSnova's user interface. The guidelines specific requirements and recommendations for accessibility, layout, styles, and components used in ARSnova's user interface. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure that ARSnova remains consistent and easy to use.

== Foundations
Foundations inform the basis for a great user interface, from accessibility standards to essential patterns for layout.

=== Accessibility
We committed to making our user interface accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities based on the requirements defined in WCAG 2.1. Developers should follow accessibility best practices to ensure that ARSnova is usable with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and keyboard-only navigation. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring that all functionality is available using the keyboard, and ensuring that color is not the only means of conveying information.

Accessibility requirements are specified across all sections. Besides there is a https://gitlab.com/particify/dev/foss/arsnova-webclient/-/blob/master/docs/a11y/Making_html_elements_a11y.md[guide for making HTML elements accessible].

=== Layout
ARSnova's layout should be clear and easy to understand for all users. Developers should use a consistent layout across all pages and ensure that important information is prominently displayed. The layout should also be flexible enough to accommodate different screen sizes and resolutions.

==== Overview
The layout should be clear and easy to understand for all users. In this section, we provide an overview of the key principles that should guide the layout of ARSnova's pages.

ARSnova's responsive design to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts and good user experience for all common devices.

.Room view on desktop device (left) and mobile device (right)
image:room_view_desktop.png[Room view on desktop device, 73.3%]
image:room_view_mobile.png[Room view on mobile device, 25.7%]


==== Anatomy
In this section, we provide guidelines for the different parts of ARSnova's interface, such as header, footerm content area and the key elements that make up our layout and their relationships to one another.

===== Header
The app header contains navigation and interaction elements which can vary depending on location (see room list vs room overview).

image:room_list_header.png[Header in room list, 49.5%]
image:room_overview_header.png[Header in room overview, 49.5%]

The header has the highest elevation and is fixed to the top on every view and screen size. For detailed specs of the headere see the <<_top_app_bar>> section.

===== Content area
The apps content are is placed between header and footer and is centered horizontally.

Content is placed as column horizontally centered with a max width of 832px (800px + padding).

For detailed specs see <<_content_area_padding>>.

===== Footer
The app footer contains navigation elements and (optional) information. No material buttons or similar should be used here to keep the footer simple and rather unobtrusive. The footers position is always at the bottom of the content area and can be hidden on smaller devices were the <<_navigation_bar>> is used.

===== Navigation
The navigation in a room varies depending on screen size and context. So the different components <<_navigation_bar>>, <<_navigation_rail>> and <<_navigation_drawer>> are used.


==== Spacing
Proper spacing is essential to ensure that ARSnova's pages are easy to read and understand. In this section, we provide guidelines for the spacing between different elements on ARSnova's pages, such as text, buttons and other components.

[cols="2,1"]
|===
|Layout attribute | Value

|Small spacer
|Small spacer ({small-spacer})

|Smaller spacer
|Smaller spacer ({smaller-spacer})

|Base spacer
|Base spacer ({base-spacer})

|Larger spacer
|Larger spacer ({larger-spacer})

|Large spacer
|Large spacer ({large-spacer})

|X-Large spacer
|X-Large spacer ({x-large-spacer})

|===

===== Content area padding
The content area has a padding of {app-padding}. This results in the actual available space (on smaller devices).

image:app_padding.png[Content area padding, 20%]

===== Lists
====== Card lists
Card lists have a spacing of Small spacer ({small-spacer}) between items.

====== Interaction lists
Interaction list like in content answering has a space of Smaller spacer (Smaller spacer ({smaller-spacer})) to ensure that the correct item is selected.

Font size is {base-font-size} and {font-size-smaller} on mobile devices.

===== Card content
Content in a card has a space of Smaller spacer ({smaller-spacer}) between items.

===== Button row
Space between 2 or more buttons in a row is Small spacer ({small-spacer}).

===== Input row
A row of inputs has a space between items of Smaller spacer ({smaller-spacer}).

===== Link row
A row of links has a space between items of Smaller spacer ({smaller-spacer}).

===== Home view
Elements in home view should use large and x-large paddings/margins for consistent spacing.

== Styles
ARSnova's visual style should be consistent, modern, and professional. Developers should follow ARSnova's style guide, which includes guidelines for typography, colors, and imagery. All text should be readable and contrast with the background. Icons should be clear and understandable. Images and graphics should be used sparingly and appropriately.

=== Colors
In ARSnova we use a custom color palette, which defines, next to primary, secondary and warn, a lot of other colors as well.

==== Background
Background color is used for the app background.

==== Surface
Surface color is used for most elements on the app background. So it's used for the <<_header>>, navigation bars or cards in the content area.

==== Primary
Primary color is used for most interactive elements like buttons of all kinds or tabs.

==== Secondary
Secondary color is used for displaying information like in badges or other non-interactive elements. Also the color is used for less prominent interactive elements like checkboxes, radio buttons and switches.

==== Warn
Warn color is used for errors and interaction elements like delete.

==== Product speficic colors
Beside the colors of the https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation[baseline Material color theme] we have a lot of product specific colors like indicators for correct or wrong answers, different chart colors and logo colors.

=== Icons
Icons are used to represent common actions. We are using the https://fonts.google.com/icons[Material icons] from Google and using them filled.

Default icon size is 24px which can vary depending on content.

=== Motion
There are some places in ARSnova were we use transitions or other animations to provide a better UX. For material components we use their default animations like in dialogs, checkboxes, expansion panels etc. Defaults for custom animations still need to be specified.

=== Shape
For the shape in ARSnova we are using the https://m2.material.io/design/shape/about-shape.html#shaping-material[default of the material design version 2].

=== Typography
Currently we are using a custom typography in ARSnova. Base font size is {base-font-size}, but not all components and text elements are oriented to this.

HTML-Headlines should be used semantically correct and can have custom font size and weight.

We need to implement a https://m2.material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale[type scale] to ensure more clear and consistent fonts across our app.

Until then the following font specs are used:

[cols="2,1, 1"]
|===
|Type | Size | Weight

|Paragraph
|{base-font-size}
|{font-weight-normal}

|Title
|{font-size-h2}

|{font-weight-normal}

|Captions
|{font-size-smaller}
|{font-weight-normal}

|Button

|{font-weight-bold}

|Headline 3
|{font-size-h3}
|{font-weight-bold}

|Headline 4
|{font-size-h4}
|{font-weight-bold}

|===

== Components

ARSnova is using https://material.angular.io/components/categories[Material Design Components (MDC)] for its user interface, such as buttons, forms, and menus, to ensure consistency and familiarity for users. Developers should follow ARSnova's component guidelines, which include specifications for size, spacing, and behavior. Custom components should be used sparingly and only when necessary to meet specific requirements.

=== Badges
https://material.angular.io/components/badge/overview[Badges] convey dynamic information, such as counts or status. We use two different types of them:

Counter badges can be placed in the upper right corner of icons or next to a text element.

.Badge of an icon (left) and beside text (right)
image:icon_badge.png[Content area padding, 20%]
image:text_badge.png[Content area padding, 21.8%]

Simple small circle badge is used to indicate unread content and can be placed in the upper right corner of an icon.

Text fields can have a trailing icon button for action like creating an element with the input value or clearing the input.

Text fields can have a hint or error message below. Inputs were the input length is limited should always show the current count and limit.

Placeholders are only used for concrete input examples or if no floating label is used.
